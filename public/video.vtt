00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Germany began in 2024.

00:04.000 --> 00:09.000
Hundreds of thousands of people protested against extremism and the AfD.

00:09.000 --> 00:16.000
They feared that the representatives of the party would turn democracy and Nazis could come to power again.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
The media houses are reported to be corrective,

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
according to which AFD politicians took part in a meeting with right-wing extremists.

00:25.000 --> 00:33.000
They should have said that people with migration history from Germany should be pushed away in large numbers.

00:33.000 --> 00:39.000
The AfD has proposed that it follows the kind of constitutional plans.

00:39.000 --> 00:44.000
However, the party has been guarded by the Federal Constitutional Protection Agency for years.

00:44.000 --> 00:53.000
The German intelligence service has already approved the AfD in 2021 as the so-called suspect case for right-wing extremists.

00:55.000 --> 01:01.000
And this is justified, as the Supreme Court has now decided in Münster.

01:01.000 --> 01:10.000
It corresponds to the political goal of the party to recognize that the German government with migration background

01:10.000 --> 01:18.000
is only a legal lower status than the understanding of the AfD ethnically German.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
This is an irresistible discrimination on the basis of abstinence.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
And with the human being, the guarantee of the basic law is not to be unified.

01:26.000 --> 01:33.000
So the judges see enough points in total to at least reason the suspect

01:33.000 --> 01:38.000
that the AfD is against the free democratic basic order of the German court.

01:38.000 --> 01:43.000
This means that the protection of the Constitution can be observed by certain people in the party,

01:43.000 --> 01:48.000
informants, and their own hidden employees.

01:48.000 --> 01:53.000
This is why it is important to protect the state from extremists.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
A lower status for the AfD, which complied against the Constitutional Protection Agency

02:02.000 --> 02:07.000
and introduced a flood of 470 proofs.

02:07.000 --> 02:12.000
After the end of the process, the AfD representatives claimed to be victims of justice

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
and accused the judge against the crime.

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
It was too short of a process. We had no chance of fair representation of our opponents.

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
And if you look at the overall trial, we have to find out what the main reasons were

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
that make us suspicious.

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
And even today, on the day of the trial, it is still not yet clear.

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
I would like to say that we have put thousands of pages of documents

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
with appropriate quotes of the court and the AfD themselves.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
These quotes are exactly covered with data

02:42.000 --> 02:47.000
and with which opportunity the affected persons have made certain exceptions.

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
And it is not just about the small, independent parties,

02:51.000 --> 02:57.000
but it is also about the exception of leading protagonists of the AfD party.

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
By the way, Björn Höcke is the head of the AfD party in the Bundesland Thüringen.

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
He is allowed to be called fascist according to a court judgment.

03:06.000 --> 03:12.000
Höcke spreads a nationwide nationalist ideology and conspiracy.

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
He claims that Germany stands before the people's death,

03:16.000 --> 03:21.000
because the ruling parties would obviously besiege the country with migrants.

03:21.000 --> 03:27.000
The former history teacher was supposed to have used a forbidden Nazi word

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
and was now personally in court for the first time.

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
Further processes should follow.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
Höcke wants to become Prime Minister.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
In autumn, Landtagswahl is in Thüringen.

03:39.000 --> 03:45.000
In order to ask, the AfD sees there at 30 percent, the strongest power.

03:45.000 --> 03:52.000
We can see very well that the whole attempt to classify the AfD and individual politicians

03:52.000 --> 03:59.000
as extremists and populists is not a special hindrance

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
for the rise of the AfD.

04:02.000 --> 04:07.000
The AfD-Landesverbände in Thüringen, Sachsen and Sachsen-Anhalt

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
have already been insured as right-wing extremists.

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
This is not yet valid for the AfD.

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
The court in Münster has only been confirmed by the suspect case.

04:20.000 --> 04:28.000
Next, the whole AfD will also be considered as a witness of right-wing extremism.

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
And how a court would then evaluate it is open.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
In the right-wing state, independent courts decide.

04:37.000 --> 04:44.000
This distinguishes our democracy in Germany from the dictators for which some of the AfD is enthusiastic.

04:44.000 --> 04:49.000
The internal minister therefore plays a scandal on Maximilian Krah,

04:49.000 --> 04:54.000
the AfD's top candidate for the European elections on the 9th of June.

04:54.000 --> 04:59.000
Krah's co-worker is supposed to have spying on China and is sitting in search of it.

04:59.000 --> 05:06.000
In addition, there is the accusation that Krah himself received money from China and Russia.

05:06.000 --> 05:13.000
The last suspect is also against the number two of the AfD in the European elections, Peter Bustron.

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
Both politicians argue about the accusation.

05:17.000 --> 05:24.000
After Münster's judgment, a debate on this is being held in Germany.

05:24.000 --> 05:30.000
In a current debate, the AfD still has two strongest powers in Germany.

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
With 17 percent, however, it has lost.

05:34.000 --> 05:41.000
At the beginning of the year, when the demonstrations began, it was still 23 percent.
